#A monster Calls

That colossus was in sight just past midnight. As most do.

Conor was conscious when it hit town.

Conor had had a bad story unfold in his mind. Not *a* bad story. *That* bad story. That of which Conor had a lot of for many days. The bad story that had that conclusion of-

Conor took a quick look at the clock his mum had put on his nightstand. 12.07. Seven minutes past midnight. Which was tardy for a school night, tardy for a Sunday, beyond doubt.

Conor had told no one about the bad story. Not his mum, obviously, not a soul, not his dad in their fortnightly (or so) phone call, obviously not his grandma, and nobody at school.

Obviously not.
