# One Monster Beckons
(A monster calls without a single A)

*One Monster Beckons*

The monster showed up succeeding midnight. Like they do.


Conor did not sleep when it did come.

Conor owned one night terror. Well, not *one* night terror. *The* night terror. The one he'd been owning plenty recently. The one with the murk, the wind, the shouting. The one with the fingers slipping from him, however firm he tried to hold on. The one which kept ending with-

"Get lost," Conor whispered into the murk of his bedroom, trying to push the night terror behind him, not let it follow him to the world of consciousness. "Get lost now."

He looked over to the clock his mum put on his bedside desk. 12.07. Twelve minutes beyond midnight. Behind time for the night before school, behind time for the weekend, definitely.

He'd told no one of the night terror. Not his mum, obviously, but no one else either, not his pop in their fortnightly (or so) phone conference, *definitely* not his eldmother, no one in school. Definitely not.

No one else ever needed to know the plot storyline in his night terror.

Conor blinked groggily in his room, then he frowned. Something seemed to be missing. He got up from his sleep, rousing more. The night terror slowly retired, but something which he could not put his finger on bothered him, something different, something-

He listened, exterting his energy on the silence, but he could only percieve the quiet house he lived in, the intermittent tick from the empty first floor or the rustle of bedding from his mum's room next door.

Nothing.

Then something. Something which woke him, he noted.

Someone beckoned him with his title.

*Conor.*

He felt rushes of fright, his guts twisting. Did it follow him? Did it somehow step out of the night terror then-

"Don't be stupid," he told himself. "You're too old for monsters."

Indeed, he'd turned thirteen in September. Monsters were for newborns. Monsters were for bed-wetters. Monsters were for-

*Conor.*

There once more. Conor gulped. The month kept being oddly hot, with his window still open. The sounds of the blinds shushing in the slight breeze could sound possibly like-

*Conor.*

OK, it's not the wind. It seemed to be definitely one voice, but not one he recognised. For sure, I couldn't be his mother's. It completely didn't sound like the opposite gender, pressing Conor for one nutty moment to wonder if his pop somehow surprisingly visited from the US but got there too behind time to phone so-

*Conor.*

No. Not his pop. This voice owned texture. Wild, brutish, monstrous texture.

Then he percieved weighty screeches of wood outside, like something humongous striding 'cross timber floors.

He didn't feel like going to see. But concurrently, some of him urged himself to look over everything.

Fully conscious now, he pushed the covers to one side, got out of bed, then went over to the window. In the dim dusk lighting of the moon, he could fully see the church tower up on the tiny hill behind his house, the one with the metro route curving beside it, two hard steel lines glowing dully in the night. The moon shone too, on the cemetery joined with the church, filled with tombstones you could not interpret nowadays.

Chapter 4
_Stories_, Conor thought with dred while he strolled home. With the end of School here, he quickly fled. He'd got through the rest of the day dodging encounters with Henry, Edwin together with Sully, though they were to likely to know not to risk "incidents" from occuring so soon since he'd been close to being spotted by Ms Quin. He's circumvented from Lily too, whom returned to lessons with red puffy eyes with a scowl you could suspend dog flesh from. When the school bell went, Conor bolted out, feeling the burden of school, Harry together with Lily drop from his shoulders while he continuesly left streets behind, between his problems. 

_Stories_, he thought once more.

"_Your_ stories," Mrs Mull told them in their English lesson. "Don't think you don't possess stories to tell despite being young."

_Life writing_, she'd mentioned it, one homework for them to write out their lifes. Their tribe member's tree, where they lived, going on trips with their joyful memories.

Interesting things which occured.

Connor shifted his book holder on his shoulder. He could think of some interesting things whihc occured. Nothing he wished to write on, though. His pop disowning him. The feline going off once, to never come home.

The time when his mother told him they needed to discuss something.

He frowned, yet he kept trotting.

But then once more, he too remembered, the event _before_ the discussion. His mum took him to his most prefered Hindi food shop, letting hinm order however much curry he wished for. Then she'd giggled, shouting, "Why the _FUCK_ not?" while ordering servings of it for herself,too.
they'd begun burping through their behinds before they'd even got into the vehicle. On the drive home, they could not stop from producing sounds so hard from their mouths and behinds.

Conor smiled just thinking of it.
